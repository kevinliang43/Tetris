A game made to emulate the original Tetris game that all of us know and love.

The game was made as a project to gain familiarity with the Racket programming language.

Pre-Requirements:
- Racket V6.2.1 or higher.

Racket available for download at https://download.racket-lang.org/

How to Run:
1. Open the TetrisV1.0.rkt (Racket Source) file.
2. Click Run on the upper right hand corner of the Racket IDE, or press Command + R.

Instructions:

1. Controls:
- Left Arrow Key: Moves the target tetris block left one space.
- Right Arrow Key: Moves the target tetris block right one space.
- Down Arrow Key: Moves the target tetris block down one space.
- Space: Brings the tetris block all the way down to the bottom-most available space.
- 'S' Key: Rotates the block clockwise.
- 'A' Key: Rotates the block counter-clockwise.

2. Goal:
Clear as many lines of tetris blocks as you can by filling up horizontal lines with tetris blocks.

The game ends when a block can no longer spawn in the top middle of the grid (i.e blocks have filled up the grid to the top)
